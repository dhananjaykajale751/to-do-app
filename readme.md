# To-Do List Application

## Overview

The To-Do List application is a simple task management app built with Node.js and Express, using EJS for templating. It allows users to add, delete, and search tasks. Each task can be accompanied by a description and is timestamped to track when it was last updated. Tasks are stored in a JSON file and displayed dynamically on the web page.

## System Design

- **Backend**: The backend is implemented using Node.js and Express. It handles requests for displaying tasks, adding new tasks, and deleting existing ones.
- **Frontend**: The frontend is created with EJS for templating, allowing dynamic rendering of tasks. Styles are managed using CSS.
- **Data Storage**: Tasks are stored in a JSON file (`data/tasks.json`), which acts as a simple data repository.
- **Search Functionality**: A search feature is implemented to filter tasks based on user input.

## Implementation

### Directory Structure

```
project-root/
│
├── app.js                 # Main server file
├── data/
│   └── tasks.json         # Dummy JSON file for task data
├── views/
│   ├── list.ejs           # EJS template for rendering tasks
│   └── styles.css         # CSS file for styling
└── package.json           # Project metadata and dependencies
```

### Main Components

- **`app.js`**: Sets up the Express server, handles routes for displaying and managing tasks, and integrates with the `tasks.json` file.
- **`views/list.ejs`**: EJS template for rendering the task list. Includes form for adding tasks, and displays tasks with options to delete and view timestamps.
- **`views/styles.css`**: CSS file for styling the application, including task items, search form, and general layout.
- **`data/tasks.json`**: JSON file that stores tasks data.

### Setting Up and Running the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Server**

   Start the Express server:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

5. **Access the Application**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Usage

- **Add a Task**: Enter the task name and description in the form and submit.
- **Delete a Task**: Click the delete icon next to the task to remove it.
- **Search Tasks**: Use the search input to filter tasks by name.

## Notes

- Tasks are stored in `data/tasks.json` and are persisted across server restarts.
- The application uses simple HTML, CSS, and EJS templating. No database is involved.
